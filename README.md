# perl-file-upload
A library to make file uploading easy.

Working demo with more than one file select field here:

Working demo with one file field and the "multiple" attribute applied

Blog post explaining the .lib file here:

The two files in <code>/css</code> are needed for the two demo scripts to display properly.

The file <code>/lib/upload.lib</code> is the magic that makes it all work for you. Make sure you view the ReadMe before implementing. It tells you how to call the subroutine for multiple individiual file fields or for file fields with the "multiple" attribute.
